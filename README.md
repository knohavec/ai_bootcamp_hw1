## Overview and Origin

- **Name of company:** [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- **Incorporation:** Founded in 2008
- **Founders:** Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett
- **Idea:** The founders wanted to create a platform that would make it easier for developers to collaborate on software projects using Git version control.
- **Funding:** GitHub has received funding from various investors and was later acquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5 billion.

## Business Activities

- **Problem:** GitHub aims to solve the problem of collaboration and version control in software development.
- **Intended Customer:** Developers, software engineers, and teams working on software projects. The market size of this customer segment is substantial, given the widespread use of software development in various industries.
- **Solution:** GitHub offers a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, facilitating collaboration, and enabling version control using Git. Its key advantage is its strong community and ecosystem of developers and projects. Github also recently launched a new product called Github Copilot, an AI assistant for programmers that can be integrated directly into their IDE.
- > "Just as GitHub was founded on Git, today we are re-founded on Copilot. It is now evident that AI is ushering in the same sweeping change, and at an exponential pace." - GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke [ITPro Today]
- **Technologies:** GitHub uses Git for version control and offers various features for project management, code review, and collaboration. Copilot is a large language model, built on similar technology to ChatGPT or other similar products. 

## Landscape
